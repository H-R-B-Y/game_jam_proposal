# Game Jam Proposal - hbreeze

## Purpose

To host a game jam for 42 London students to inspire creativity, collaboration, and practical game development experience.

## Goals

1. Encourage teamwork and creative problem-solving.
2. Provide a platform for students to apply their skills in a fun, time-constrained environment
3. Foster a community of collaboration and learning under pressure.
4. Offer students an opportunity to experiment with game design within the constraints of the 42 cursus.

## Scope

Initially, the event will be open to 42 London students. If successful, and with sufficient interest and peer support, we could consider extending the event to other campuses.

## Rules / Technical Constraints

To encourage collaboration, teams should consist of a minimum of two and a maximum of four members.

### Languages and Libraries

To encourage participation, any language/library is allowed.

## Theme Selection

To build community engagement and generate excitement for the event, I would like to include a theme selection process. This could involve collecting theme suggestions from students, followed by a voting phase to curate a shortlist, and finally a random selection from the top-voted themes to determine the final theme. I would be happy to organise this process.

Alternatively, we could use an online theme generator to randomly select a theme. This would introduce more of a surprise element and limit participants’ ability to prepare in advance.

The theme would be announced the day of.

## Submission System

For submissions, I believe there are several possible approaches:

- GitHub Repository: Each team creates their own repository and submits the link.
This option is the easiest to manage and requires little oversight. However, it leaves room for late commits after the deadline.

- GitHub Repository + Archive Submission: Each team submits their repository link along with a .zip archive of their final code at the deadline.
This requires slightly more management but ensures we have a verifiable snapshot of the final submission.

- GitHub Repository + Metadata Tracking: Each team creates a repository and a script tracks the commit history to identify the state of the code at the deadline.
This would require some setup but would allow precise verification of when code was last modified.

- Externally Managed Repository: Repositories are created and managed by the event organisers.
Similar to how Vogsphere manages submissions at 42, these repositories could be made read-only once the deadline passes. This would involve the most work but would offer full control. I would be interested in implementing such a system myself, provided we handle data protection and privacy appropriately.

## Duration

Since the event will be open to students at all levels of the cursus, I believe a duration of 5–7 days would be ideal. This length would give beginners time to find their footing and produce something meaningful, while also keeping advanced students engaged.

A longer timeframe also accommodates students balancing school and personal responsibilities such as work. However, I would be open to a shorter event if there is sufficient interest from participants.

## Judging Criteria

Judging could be based on the following criteria or some entirely different set, depending on what the community feels is most important:

- Creativity and Originality: How unique and innovative is the game concept?

- Technical Execution: How well is the game implemented, including code quality and performance?

- Gameplay and Fun Factor: How engaging and enjoyable is the game to play?

- Adherence to Theme: How effectively does the game incorporate the chosen theme?

- Presentation: How polished and professional is the final product, including visuals and audio?

### Judging Panel

While peer evaluation would be in the spirit of 42, it could also be beneficial to involve a dedicated panel of judges. This panel would not participate in the event to ensure impartiality. Potential judges could include:

- 42 London staff members (non-participants)
- Alumni with game-development experience (if available / applicable, could ask other campuses?)
- Local game developers or industry professionals (unlikely, but worth considering)
- Experienced students (non-participants)
- Experienced gamers (volunteers)

A combination of peer review and panel judging could also be used to balance perspectives and encourage community involvement.

### Prizes and Recognition (Optional)

While prizes are not essential, they could provide additional motivation for participation. Possible rewards include:

- Certificates of achievement
- Features on 42 London’s website or social media
- Medals or trophies

These are entirely optional; the focus of the event would remain on creativity, learning, and community rather than competition.

### Team Presentations (Optional)

To celebrate the creativity and effort of participants, an optional (hackathon style) presentation session could be offered at the end of the jam.

Teams will have a few minutes to showcase their game, discuss their approach, and share lessons learned.

This encourages peer learning, collaboration, and community engagement in a relaxed, supportive environment.

## Resources Needed

- Venue: 42 London campus facilities
- Administrative Approval: Permission from 42 London management to host the event
- Promotion: Posters, internal announcements, or social-media posts (optional)
- Judging Panel: Volunteers from staff, alumni, or students (as available)
- Organiser(s): While I am happy to take the lead on organising, additional support from other peers or staff would be beneficial.

## Risk Management

While the event is low-risk, there are a few potential issues worth noting:

### Security Risks

Although unlikely, participants could submit unsafe or malicious code. To mitigate this, participants will be reminded that all submissions must contain original, non-destructive code. Judges and participants will be encouraged to review code before executing binaries.

Testing could be done in isolated environments (e.g., virtual machines or containers) to further reduce risk.

### Data Protection

If participant data (e.g., team names or repository links) is collected for submissions, it will only be used for administrative purposes and removed once the event concludes.

### Technical Issues

In the event of technical problems with the submission system or repository locking, a backup submission method (e.g., manual GitHub link or archive upload) will be provided.

### Disputes or Rule Ambiguity

Clear judging criteria and rules will be published before the jam begins. Any disputes will be resolved by the judging panel or organizing team.
